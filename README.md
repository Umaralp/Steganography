Image Steganography with Passcode Security
Overview
This project implements image steganography using Python and OpenCV. It allows users to hide secret messages inside an image while ensuring security with passcode protection for decryption.

Project Structure
encryption.py – Encrypts a message inside an image and saves the output.
decryption.py – Decrypts the hidden message from the encrypted image.
mypic.png – The original image used for hiding the message.
encryptedImage.png – The output image containing the hidden message.
passcode.txt – Stores the passcode for decryption.
LICENSE – Project license (GPL-3.0).
README.md – Project documentation.
Features
✔️ Secure Message Hiding – Stores text inside image pixels.
✔️ Passcode Protection – Ensures only authorized users can decrypt.
✔️ Lightweight & Fast – Minimal performance overhead.
✔️ Open Source – Free to modify and expand.
